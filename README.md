# Pennsylvania Car Accident Analysis
Analysis and exploration of a public dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents). 

Using Jupyter Notebook and Python I walk through my thought process from formatting and filtering the data to visualizing the locations and times of accidents. Over 10 key insights are extracted.

Future goals are to incorporate weather data and build a machine learning model to predict severity.
